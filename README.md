> v2.4.1

A multi-lingual songbook and tool set web app for the Neocatechumenal Way.

This site is NOT AN OFFICIAL SITE OF THE NEOCATECHUMENAL WAY, it only tries to create a compilation of most of the psalms and songs of 'The Way' in various languages/countries (See [languages](#languages) for which ones are currently implemented). All audio sources and text try to be as faithful as possible to Kiko Argüello's intentions for the psalms of 'The Way', but we are all called to be first faithful to Christ, our catechists, our formators and our responsibles who have transmitted these psalms to us. Please see [sources](#sources) for information on where the audio/text is coming from for each language. As always when in doubt, consult your catechist!

I have created this repository and opened it to the public for two reasons: First to help me keep track of changes to the site and to open the door to collaboration for whoever would like to contribute to the project. Second because as Christians we are all called to live in the Truth and to give freely to others what has been given freely to us, and I believe that open source software fulfills both of these roles by giving anyone the ability to see the Truth of what the source code is doing and to copy, change, use and distribute the code freely.

### Sources

#### English - US

All English psalm audio is sourced from my catechists, which includes recordings from Francesco, Giuseppe, Emanuele, Osvaldo, and some unknown cantors. These audio files were the ones directed to me and as such should be used to learn the English psalms only with permission from your own catechists, until the time comes when there is a central verified source for the English US psalms.

The lyrics, chords, steps and tags are sourced from the 2019 version of the 'He Rose From Death - Songs for the Neocatechumenal Communities' book.

#### Spanish - ES

All Spanish psalm audio is sourced predominantly from the [Centro Neocatechumenal de Madrid Website](https://cantos.cnc.madrid) with some audio from the [Cantor del Camino YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CantorDelCamino) page to fill in some gaps.

The lyrics, chords, steps and tags are sourced from the 2023 version of the 'Resucitó - Cantos Para Las Comunidades Neocatecumenales' book.
