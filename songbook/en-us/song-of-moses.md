[C]

C7                  F
Let us sing to the Lord,
                    A7
let us sing to the Lord.
                        D7
He covered himself in glory,

in glory, in glory.
                        G7
He has thrown into the sea
           C7
horse and rider.

[A]

                    F
MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG
        A7
IS THE LORD.
             D7
HE IS MY SALVATION

IS MY GOD,
         G7
I WILL EXALT HIM
                        C7
HE HAS THROWN INTO THE SEA

HORSE AND RIDER,

HORSE AND RIDER.

[C]

               F
The Lord is a warrior.
               A7
Yahweh is his Name.
            D7
Pharaoh's chariots

and the enemy's army
                  G7
He cast into the sea.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN...

HORSE AND RIDER. (2)

MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG ...

[CC]

Your right hand, O Lord,
glorious in power,
your right hand, O Lord,
shattered the enemy,
shattered the enemy.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...

[CC]

The enemy said:
I shall pursue and overtake.
I shall draw my sword.
I will share the spoils,
my hand will destroy them.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...

[CC]

You blew with your breath
the sea covered them.
They sank like lead
in deep waters,
in the waters of death.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...

[CC]

Who is like you among the god
who is like you, O Lord,
magnificent in holiness
terrible in deeds,
worker of wonders.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...

[CC]

You led this people
that you have rescued,
with strength you guided them
with strength and with love
up to your holy dwelling.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...

[CC]

You brought them in
and planted them
on the mountain of the promi:
where, O Lord, you reign,
you reign for all eternity,
you reign forever.

[A]

HE HAS THROWN ...
