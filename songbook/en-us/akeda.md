Am                      Dm9
It was still night when Abraham
                           Am
prepared to sacrifice his son;
                               Dm9
the two looked in each other's eyes
            E
when Isaac said:

Am         Dm9           Am
AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA.
Am                Dm9
BIND ME, BIND ME FAST,
                     Am
MY FATHER, LEST I RESIST!

[C]

                           Dm9
Bind me, bind me fast, my father,
                      Am
lest out of fear I resist

                           Dm9
and your sacrifice be not valid
                      E
and both of us are rejected!

[A]

Am         Dm9           Am
AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA ...

[C]

Am
Come and see faith on earth
                      Dm9
come and see faith on earth:

a father who sacrifices his only son
                                        E
and his dearest son offering him his throat.

[A]

Am         Dm9           Am
AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA, AKEDA ...
