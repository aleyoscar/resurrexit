[A]

Em                     G
O LORD, OUR GOD, HOW GREAT IS YOUR NAME.
              B7
ABOVE ALL THE EARTH, YOUR NAME;
           Am                 B7
ABOVE THE HEAVENS RISES YOUR LOVE!

[C]

Am                           B7
By the mouth of children and infants
       Am                 B7
You affirm your power, O Lord,
C                                 B7
to reduce to silence enemies and rebels.

O LORD, OUR GOD ...

[C]

Am                                           B7
If | look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
                   Am                    B7
the moon and the stars which you have established,
C                                     B7
what is man that you should care for him,
C                                        B7
the son of man that you should think of him?
     G        B7                                         C
And yet, and yet, you have made him little less than the angels
                                B7
with glory and honor you have crowned him.
C                                  B7
Everything you have put under his feet.

[A]

O LORD, OUR GOD ...
