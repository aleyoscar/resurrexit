[A]

G                       Em
EXULT, YOU JUST IN THE LORD,
G                           G
PRAISE IS FITTING FROM THE SAINTS,
                          Em
PRAISE THE LORD WITH THE ZITHER,
         C
WITH THE TENSTRINGED HARP,
         G
SING TO HIM.

[C]

Am                      B7
Sing a new song to the Lord,
Am                               B7
play the zither with art and acclaim him:
         C
for the Word of the Lord is right,
D                   B7
truth, are all his works.
    C
In him are justice and right,
        D                  B7
of his love, the earth is full.

G                       Em
EXULT, YOU JUST IN THE LORD ...

[C]

Am                             B7
The Word of the Lord made the heavens,
      Am                         B7
the breath of his mouth all his hosts.
     C
The Lord brings to nothing

the designs of the nations,
       D                      B7
and defeats the plans of the peoples.
          C
But the plan of the Lord,
      D                         B7
the plan of the Lord, stands forever.

[A]

G                       Em
EXULT, YOU JUST IN THE LORD ...
